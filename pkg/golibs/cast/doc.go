Package cast contains some utility functions for casting types. The first version
contains the cast of the simple types (int, string, bool, etc.) to cast their scalar
variables to the pointers and pointers to the variables of the simple types to the
variables of the types. The casting maybe useful when it needs to distinguish whether
a value is passed from the default values (in JSON objects, for example). In this
case the target golang structures may use pointers to the types instead of the concrete
types to understand whether a value was not provided (pointer is nil), or what its value
if it is provided.
